IO-LUA is a 2D game engine for Lua.

Current platform support: Linux, Mac OS X, Windows
Dependencies: SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, Lua 5

How to use it:
==============

There is a sample application provided with this game engine.
If you just want to test it out, then compile this project then 
run ./build/io-lua or ./build/io-lua.exe

If you want to script your own lua game, edit the files 
inside the ./game folder. You can add any files you want in the 
game folder, just make sure that config.lua and game.lua exist.

When the game engine executable is ran, it looks in the game 
folder from the current directory and runs config.lua and then 
game.lua. 

After compiling, these output files will be in the build folder:

constants.lua	- This will always be the first script executed
		by the game engine

io-lua(.exe)	- The game engine executable

game/		- The folder containing the Lua game scripts
		and assets

How to compile:
===============
Note: Every time you compile, everything in the build folder gets overwritten.

For Linux or Mac OS X:

If you have not done this already, download the source code to SDL2, SDL2 image, 
SDL2 ttf, and Lua. Run ./configure && sudo make install on each of them.

Then go to this project and run ./configure && make


For Windows do the following:

The .lib and .dll files are already provided so just run build.bat 
from a Visual Studio Command Prompt.

If you ever edit the game engine, run build.bat again



About config.lua:
=================
This script will be executed by the game engine before running your game.
It's usually used to set game engine variables before the video and audio is initialized.
All game engine variables will assume their individual default values if left uninitialized.

List of game engine variables:

gamepath	- Directory of game that contains the lua scripts and assets
datapath	- Directory of where game can write data
fps		- Maximum frames per second
v_width		- Window width in pixels (X coordinates)
v_height	- Window height in pixles (Y coordinate)
v_driver	- Index of video driver to use
v_renderer	- Index of render driver to use
v_fullscreen	- 1 or 0 for fullscreen
v_grab		- 1 or 0 for grabbing mouse input to not leave the window
s_volume	- Volume of sound. 0.0 is mute, 1.0 is full volume, there is no enforced volume limit.
s_driver	- Index of sound driver to use
s_device	- Index of sound device to use for output
s_freq		- Speed of sound playback
s_format	- Bit size of sound samples (8, 16, or 32)
s_channels	- 1 for mono, 2 for stereo
s_samples	- Audio buffer size in samples

About game.lua:
===============
This is the lua script that the game engine will call after config.lua.
The game engine will pass control to Lua by invoking the function main.

The signature for the main function is:

function main(event, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
	...
end

event will be one of the following values:

EVENT_INIT:
	This event will be passed only once when the game is initializing.
	The Lua game should load and initialize any assets it needs.

EVENT_UPDATE:
	This event will be passed each frame. The Lua game should update things 
	such as animations.

EVENT_KEYBOARD:
	The user has pressed a key from the keyboard.
	arg1 is the key they pressed (see constants.lua for a list of key constants)
	arg2 is PRESSED for pressed or RELEASED for released.

EVENT_MOUSEBUTTON:
	The user has clicked with their mouse.
	arg1 is the x coordinate of the mouse.
	arg2 is the y coordinate of the mouse.
	arg3 is the BUTTON_LEFT, BUTTON_MIDDLE, or BUTTON_RIGHT.
	arg4 is PRESSED for pressed or RELEASED for released.

EVENT_SHUTDOWN:
	The game is shutting down. The Lua game should free any handles it has opened.

 
The game engine exports the following functions to Lua:
